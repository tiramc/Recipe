			<li>Pour into a bowl or container and cover; set in refrigerator until chilled. Serve. </li>

		<h3 style="color:green"> Notes </h3>
		<p> <i>How moist/dry your quinoa will dictate how much almond milk you need for this recipe. Mine was leftover in the fridge so it was pretty dry- I used 1 full cup. You can also use a ripe banana instead of dates to sweeten and flavor the pudding.</i></p>
